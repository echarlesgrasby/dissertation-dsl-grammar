# dissertation-dsl-grammar

Langium grammar project for the DSL that I am building as part of my doctoral research. Codenamed MERLIN, which is a nod to H. Beam Piper's novel *The Cosmic Computer*.

I'm still currently laying the groundwork so that I can plan the construction of this grammar. More to come!

### 2025-08-04 Update

I am working on completing the proposal document (essentially the first 2 chapters of my dissertation) in order to perform my proposal defense this fall. Once the proposal is complete, I can break ground on the actual prototype application. 
In the meantime, I have been working on completing a Delphi study with a group of experts that match the ideal user persona for this kind of system. I anticipate that this semester (Fall 2025) will include completion of the following milestones:

1. Complete Delphi Study round #2
    1. - [ ] Round #2 officially **closes on 10/10/2025**
3. Write and distribute round #2 whitepaper to panel participants
4. Synthesize functional requirements document from Delphi Study results
5. Complete (and pass!) dissertation proposal defense in September 2025
    1. - [X] Passed on September 30, 2025 with a unanimous "move forward" vote from my committee
6. Write and complete chapter 3 of dissertation (requirements modeling and analysis)
7. Start gathering test data for prototype
