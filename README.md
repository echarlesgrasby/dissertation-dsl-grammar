### 2025-08-04 Update

I am working on completing the proposal document (essentially the first 2 chapters of my dissertation) in order to perform my proposal defense this fall. Once the proposal is complete, I can break ground on the actual prototype application. 
In the meantime, I have been working on completing a Delphi study with a group of experts that match the ideal user persona for this kind of system. I anticipate that this semester (Fall 2025) will include completion of the following milestones:

1. Complete Delphi Study round #2
2. Write and distribute round #2 whitepaper to panel participants
3. Synthesize functional requirements document from Delphi Study results
4. Complete (and pass!) dissertation proposal defense in September 2025
5. Write and complete chapter 3 of dissertation (requirements modeling and analysis)
6. Start gathering test data for prototype
